Whole slide images (WSIs) contain rich information for cancer diagnosis, biomarker expression prediction, and patient survival outcome estimation. However, analyzing WSIs remains challenging due to their large size and the scarcity of expert annotations. Multiple instance learning (MIL) models have emerged as the dominant approach for WSI classification. Our lab is dedicated to developing novel MIL models by leveraging foundation models, graph-based methods, and attention mechanisms to advance WSI-based diagnostic tasks.

Multimodal learning, which integrates radiological images (e.g., CT, MRI), H&E-stained slides, and genomic data, enhances the prediction of molecular biomarker status, patient treatment responses, and survival outcomes. However, the simultaneous acquisition of genomic, pathological, and radiological data is often limited by cost and technical constraints. To overcome this challenge, our lab focuses on developing novel knowledge-distillation models that effectively integrate multimodal data during training while dynamically adapting to available data during inference.

In clinical applications, generating medical images such as IHC slides is costly and time-consuming. Additionally, acquiring multimodal medical images is challenging, as missing modalities frequently occur across different patients and clinical centers. To address these limitations, our lab focuses on developing novel generative AI models by leveraging GANs, diffusion models, and contrastive learning strategies for biomedical applications.

Our lab's research goal is to advance basic understanding of dsRNA editing and sensing to develop better tools for diagnosis and treatment of inflammatory disease patients. Specifically, we ask three questions:

  - How do self dsRNAs evade innate immune sensing?
  - How do disease associated genetic variants affect dsRNA editing and sensing?
  - Which disease relevant cells are the trigger of immune response due to unwanted RNA sensing?

We employ an integrated approach including both computational and experimental tools to address basic questions in dsRNA editing and sensing. By doing so, we aim to bring new insights into autoimmunity and RNA therapeutics.
